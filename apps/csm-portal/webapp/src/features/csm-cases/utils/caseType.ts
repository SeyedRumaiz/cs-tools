 * "every type" request from this instead of {@link ALL_CASE_TYPES}
 * directly, or a caller who can't see security reports gets a 403 on a
 * search that also asks for ordinary cases, service requests, etc. —
 * reported live.
 *

 * (`cs_engineer || admin || comment_updater` — see that permission's own
 * doc comment in `access.go`), not just `canUseSecurityCenter`
 * (`cs_engineer || admin`): a `comment_updater`-only caller holds the
